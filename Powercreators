The LinkedIn Creator team is looking for power creators who use their personal profile as a company or influencer page.
If someone's LinkedIn page has more followers than the company they work for, we can safely assume that person is a power creator.
Write a query to return the IDs of these LinkedIn power creators ordered by the IDs.
Assumption:
Each person with a LinkedIn profile in this database works at one company only.
