Microsoft Azure's capacity planning team wants to understand how much data its customers are using, 
and how much spare capacity is left in each of its data centers. You’re given three tables: customers, data centers, and forecasted_demand.
Write a query to find each data centre’s total unused server capacity. Output the data center id in ascending order and the total spare capacity.
Definitions:
monthly_capacity is the total monthly server capacity for each centers.
monthly_demand is the server demand for each customer.

datacenters Table:
Column Name	Type
datacenter_id	    integer
name	            string
monthly_capacity	integer

forecasted_demand Table:
Column Name       	Type
customer_id	        integer
datacenter_id     	integer
monthly_demand    	integer

SQL SCRIPT

with cte as 
(select datacenter_id,sum(monthly_demand) as total_demand
from forecasted_demand fd
group by datacenter_id)
select cte.datacenter_id,
monthly_capacity-total_demand as unused_capacity
from cte join datacenters
on cte.datacenter_id=datacenters.datacenter_id
order by cte.datacenter_id
