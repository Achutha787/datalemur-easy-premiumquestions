Google marketing managers are analyzing the performance of various advertising accounts over the last month. They need your help to gather the relevant data.
Write a query to calculate the return on ad spend (ROAS) for each advertiser across all ad campaigns. 
Round your answer to 2 decimal places, and order your output by the advertiser_id.

Hint: ROAS = Ad Revenue / Ad Spend

ad_campaigns Table:
Column Name	     Type
campaign_id	     integer
spend	           integer
revenue          float
advertiser_id    integer

SQL SCRIPT
select advertiser_id,
round(((sum(revenue)/sum(spend))::decimal),2) as ROAS 
from ad_campaigns
group by advertiser_id
order by advertiser_id
