Assume that you are given the table below containing information on various orders made by eBay customers.
Write a query to obtain the user IDs and number of products purchased by the top 3 customers; these customers must have spent at least $1,000 in total.
Output the user id and number of products in descending order. To break ties (i.e., if 2 customers both bought 10 products), the user who spent more should take precedence.

user_transactions Table:
Column Name	Type
transaction_id	    integer
product_id	        integer
user_id           	integer
spend             	decimal

SQL SCRIPT

select user_id, count(product_id)
as prod_cnt
from user_transactions
group by user_id
having sum(spend)>=1000
order by prod_cnt desc ,sum(spend) DESC
limit 3;
