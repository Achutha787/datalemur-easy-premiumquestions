Apple has a trade-in program where their customers can return the old iPhone device to Apple and Apple gives the customers the trade-in value (known as payout) of the device in cash.

For each store, write a query of the total revenue from the trade-in. Order the result by the descending order.

trade_in_transactions Table:
Column Name	       Type

trade_in_payouts Table:
Column Name	       Type

payout_amount	     integer

SQL SCRIPT

select store_id,sum(payout_amount) as total
from trade_in_transactions tt join 
trade_in_payouts tip on tt.model_id=tip.model_id
group by store_id
order by total desc;
